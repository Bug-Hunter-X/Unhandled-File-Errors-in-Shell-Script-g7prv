# Unhandled File Errors in Shell Script

This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with files.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to read and process a file, but it crashes if the file is missing or inaccessible. The `bugSolution.sh` script demonstrates the corrected version with robust error handling.
